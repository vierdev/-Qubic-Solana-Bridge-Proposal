# üåâ Solana ‚Üî Qubic Bridge Proposal

## üîé Overview

This project aims to develop a robust, secure, and fully decentralized cross-chain bridge connecting the **Qubic blockchain (a non-EVM platform)** with the high-performance **Solana network**. This bridge will enable seamless, trust-minimized bi-directional token transfers, empowering users to convert native Qubic tokens (**Qu**) into wrapped tokens (**wQUBIC**) on Solana and redeem them back on Qubic.

By implementing this interoperability layer, the bridge unlocks enhanced liquidity, broader DeFi integration opportunities, and cross-chain asset mobility for users of both ecosystems. The solution will comprise well-audited smart contracts on both blockchains, a reliable backend relayer service for secure message relay and validation, and an intuitive frontend interface facilitating smooth user interactions.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. User Interface (Frontend)
The frontend application, developed using **Next.js** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**, provides a responsive and intuitive user experience. It enables users to seamlessly connect their wallets‚Äî**Phantom** for Solana and **Metamask Snap** (currently experimental) for Qubic. Through this interface, users select the desired token swap direction, specify the amount, and initiate the transaction while tracking its real-time status.

### 2. Smart Contract Operations
On the blockchain layer, carefully designed smart contracts enforce token custody and minting logic:

- **Qubic ‚Üí Solana**: When a user initiates a swap from Qubic to Solana, the Qubic smart contract securely locks the specified amount of Qu tokens. Upon successful lock confirmation, the backend relayer validates the event and triggers the minting of an equivalent amount of wrapped tokens (`wQUBIC`) on the Solana network.

- **Solana ‚Üí Qubic**: Conversely, when transferring from Solana back to Qubic, the Solana program burns the user‚Äôs `wQUBIC` tokens. The backend confirms the burn event before instructing the Qubic smart contract to release the equivalent amount of Qu tokens to the user‚Äôs wallet.

### 3. Relayer Backend (Python)
The bridge‚Äôs backend, implemented in Python, operates as a secure, event-driven relayer service. It continuously monitors both blockchains for relevant events (token locks and burns), verifies transaction validity, protects against replay attacks, and orchestrates cross-chain communication by relaying validated instructions to the destination network. Additionally, it exposes RESTful APIs allowing the frontend to fetch transaction statuses and swap histories for a transparent user experience.

## üîÑ Swap Flow Summary

| Swap Direction   | Origin Chain Action                     | Backend Relayer Role                      | Destination Chain Action               |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Qu ‚Üí wQUBIC**  | User locks Qu tokens in the Qubic smart contract | Detect and validate lock event, construct secure relay message | Mint equivalent `wQUBIC` tokens to user's Solana wallet |
| **wQUBIC ‚Üí Qu**  | User burns `wQUBIC` tokens in the Solana program | Detect and validate burn event, construct secure relay message | Unlock equivalent Qu tokens to user's Qubic wallet |

**Key Relayer Responsibilities:**
- Real-time event monitoring on both chains  
- Robust validation and signature verification  
- Replay protection to prevent duplicate transactions  
- Reliable message formatting and forwarding  

The destination chain smart contracts verify all relayed data to ensure security and integrity before executing token minting or unlocking.

## üéØ Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to establish a secure, efficient, and user-friendly bridge enabling seamless token interoperability between the Qubic and Solana blockchains. This involves:

- Designing and deploying robust smart contracts that guarantee the secure locking, unlocking, minting, and burning of tokens across both chains.
- Developing a reliable backend relayer system responsible for secure cross-chain communication, event validation, and prevention of replay or double-spend attacks.
- Creating an intuitive, responsive frontend interface that simplifies wallet connections and swap operations for end users.
- Ensuring the entire system is scalable, maintainable, and prepared for production deployment with comprehensive documentation and audit readiness.
